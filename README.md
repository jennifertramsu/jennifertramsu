### Hello! 👋
Chemical engineering and ... computer science?? You won't find that here, I just like to start random personal projects and add unnecessary spaces between lines of code.

<h3>🔭 I’m currently working on ...</h3>
<li>A scraper to fetch and notify transcript updates from Minerva</li>


<h3>🌱 Some previous projects:</h3>
<li> A ML pipeline to decode neural activity </li>
<li>Implementing a Physics-Informed Neural Network in Julia</li>
<li>A bioinformatics NGS pipeline to detect cancer driver mutations</li>
<li>Molecular dynamics simulation of a CO2-H2O gas hydrate system to predict rheological properties</li>
<li>Convolutional neural network to colourize greyscale images</li>
<li>Minesweeper in Python and Java</li>
<li>Two-phase flash calculation in MATLAB (assignment)</li>
<li>Spatial concentration prediction of hygroscopic beads in MATLAB (assignment)</li>
<li>Text-based console interactive story game based on Jack and the Beanstalk (hackathon)</li>
<li>Earth-Sun orbit simulation (hackathon)</li>
<li>A half-functional discord bot that spits out kaomojis at your command</li>
