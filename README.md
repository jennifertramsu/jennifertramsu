### Hello! 👋
Chemical engineering and ... computer science?? You won't find that here, I just like to start random personal projects and add unnecessary spaces between lines of code.

I'm currently working on:
- 🌱 How to implement molecular dynamic simulations using LAMMPS
- 🌱 A scraper to fetch and notify transcript updates from Minerva
- 🌱 A scraper to automatically download textbooks from [redacted]

I've worked on:
- A minesweeper in Python and Java
