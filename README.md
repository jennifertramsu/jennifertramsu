### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
Chemical engineering and ... computer science?? You won't find that here, I just like to start random personal projects and add unnecessary spaces between lines of code.

I'm currently working on:
- ðŸŒ± How to implement molecular dynamic simulations using LAMMPS
- ðŸŒ± A scraper to fetch and notify transcript updates from Minerva
- ðŸŒ± A scraper to automatically download textbooks from [redacted]

Some previous projects:
- Minesweeper in Python and Java
- Two-phase flash calculation in MATLAB (assignment)
- Spatial concentration prediction of hygroscopic beads in MATLAB (assignment)
- Text-based console interactive story game based on Jack and the Beanstalk (hackathon)
- Earth-Sun orbit simulation (hackathon)
- A half-functional discord bot that spits out kaomojis at your command
